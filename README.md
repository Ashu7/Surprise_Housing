> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
- The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables.
- Surprise Housing Dataset.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We got some of the important predictors by using Lasso regression. i.e. Street, LotArea, Utilities,
BldgType, SaleCondition, YrSold, GarageCars, KitchenQual
- We then doubled our alpha value & then we found it that we lost our important predictors & we got new predictors i.e. MSZoning, LotArea ,BsmtQual,BsmtFinType2, ExterCond
- Doing Lasso regression we got some important predictor features.

## Technologies Used
- numpy, pandas
- matplotlib, seaborn
- sklearn
